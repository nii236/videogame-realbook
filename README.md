The Videogame Realbook
==================
This project aims to create a jazz fakebook comprising of only videogame tunes.

The majority of tunes are transcribed from the handwritten sheets on thevideogamerealbook.tumblr.com. 

TODO

+ Script a makefile that will compile all .ly files and then inserts the PDFs into LaTeX
+ Make the actual LaTeX template in the first place
+ Edit .ly files so that the consist only of the melody and harmony changes (the rest will be in the template)
