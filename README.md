The Videogame Realbook
==================
This project aims to create a jazz fakebook comprising of only videogame tunes. For some reason this hasn't been attempted very often so I decided to start this project myself in an attempt to learn some basic scripting, Lilypond, LaTeX and actually use the book for performances along the way.

The majority of tunes are transcribed from the handwritten sheets on [The Videogame Realbook](http://thevideogamerealbook.tumblr.com/) website.

Songbook compilation instructions are located [here](http://jboor.net/brdm/?p=172). 

TODO
====
+ Music

  + Find other sources of videogame music on other websites
  + Transcribe my own tunes by ear
+ Project/Scripting
  + Script a makefile that will compile all .ly files and then inserts the PDFs into LaTeX
  + Make the actual Lilypond template which can  insert melody and harmonies into
    + Edit .ly files so that the consist only of the melody and harmony changes (the rest will be in the template)
